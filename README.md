# Gauss Jordan
This project is my university project for programming an app to solve some matrix and equation systems problem.

# GUI
This app is a GUI app which developed by java and JavaFX as rendering framework.
So maybe you need setup some fundamentals to running this app.

First you need to download the JavaFX SDK and then you need to setup VM options in your ide.
You can find out how do these by searching in google.
