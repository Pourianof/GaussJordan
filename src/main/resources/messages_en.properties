guide=Guide
interactiveMatrix=Interactive Matrix
row=Row
column=Column
goToIdx=Go to index
generate=Generate
outOfBound=Some Row or Column is out of bound
addRow=Add new ROW
calcDeter=Calculate Determinant
calcInverse=Calculate Inverse
solveMatrix=Solve The Matrix
squareErr=Input Matrix is not square, mean that number of row {0} is not equal with number of columns {1}
matrixFromFile=Matrix from file
matrixMan=Insert Matrix manually
guideManTitle=Insert matrix manually
guideManDesc=As displayed in following image, you can use add new row or column with buttons(1.3, 1.2)
guideMan1=You can generate the matrix just with specifying the desired rows and columns
guideMan2=Add new column button
guideMan3=Add new row button
guideMan4=Change the focus to specific index of matrix for modify or view
guideManNote1=You can use the "tab" button while working on indices of matrix to change the focus to next element of matrix without using mouse
guideManNote2=If you leave some elements(indices) empty then the coefficient of that element will be zero
guideManNote3=If the matrix get bigger than the window of program which lead to some part of matrix get hidden, then you can use scrollbar or just with dragging the matrix with your mouse to move on matrix
guideFileTitle=Insert a file include Coefficient Matrix
guideFile1=You can insert a new file of matrix by clicking on the *2.1* button
guideFile2=A brief info of inserted matrix will be display at *2.2* contains number of rows and columns
guideFile3=A preview of inserted matrix will be display at section *2.3*
guideFileNote1=First of all the file should have ".txt" extension. The containing coefficient matrix in file should follow some format.\
  Firstly no element(index) should be left out, means number of columns of all rows must be equal,otherwise the program can't determine\
  the left out indices belong to which column to consider them as zero. If number of columns a row be less than the longest row, then \
  that row will fill with zero to make both same length
guideFileNote2=Each row of matrix must be inserted at single line of text file and each element must separate with another one with single\
  blank space character(' '). Avoid using illegal characters (punctuation characters or signs other than positive and negative).
guideFileSampleValidMatrix=The following image show a sample of valid file with coefficient matrix
guideCalculate=After insert your matrix in either way, you can execute the calculation you want with these three buttons.
guideCalculateExample=For example the following image display the result of inserting a matrix file and then clicking on "Solve the matrix" button
appGuide=Program guide
waysToInsertMatrix=There are two ways which you can insert a matrix
matrixFilePreview=Preview of matrix in the file
insertFileBtn=Insert file
rowNumber=Number of rows
colNumber=Number of columns
saveInFile=Save the result in file
upTriangle=Main diagonal after Upper triangular
noteToRow=Note to the row
unInvertibleMsg=The matrix is not invertible
invertibleMsg=The matrix is invertible
infiniteSolutions=System has infinite solutions
noSolution=System has no solutions
matrixInverse=Inverse of matrix
solvedMatrix=Solved matrix
solve1Hint=Matrix has only one solution
solve2Hint=The 0=0 situation happened, then there are infinite solution
solve3Hint= Matrix have no answer because of $PH_1$
